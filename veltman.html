<h2 id="veltmans-epistemic-modals">Veltman’s Epistemic Modals</h2>
<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>The first few pages of <span class="citation">Veltman (1996)</span> provides a simple test semantics for ‘might’ that has become hugely influential in the literature on epistemic modals and indicative conditionals. Here I present, first, the actual semantics Veltman gives, and, second, a more standard variant of it assumed in the literature. I then comment on some features of the semantics, including its relationship to treatment of epistemic modality in <span class="citation">Yalcin (2007)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h4>
<p>Assume a set of <em>worlds</em>, <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>. Contexts (sample <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>) are just sets of worlds. Atomic formulae <span class="math inline">\(a \ldots z\)</span> are assigned sets of worlds by the interpretation function <span class="math inline">\(I : A \to \mathcal{P}(W)\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="veltmans-dynamic-semantics">Veltman’s dynamic semantics</h4>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is atomic:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(c[\phi] = c \cap I(\phi)\)</span></p>
<p>for any <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(c[\lnot \phi] = c \backslash c[\phi]\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(c[\phi \land \psi ] = c[\phi] \cap c[\psi]\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(c[\phi \lor \psi ] = c[\phi] \cup c[\psi]\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(c[\Diamond \phi] = \{ w \in c : c[\phi] \neq \emptyset \}\)</span></p>
<p>(<em>or, equivalently:</em></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(c[\Diamond \phi] = \begin{cases} c \text{,  if } c[\phi] \neq \emptyset \\ \emptyset \text{,  otherwise} \end{cases}\)</span>)</p>
<h4 id="standard-modifications">Standard modifications</h4>
<p>Veltman’s semantics both does not explicitly define ‘must’ as the dual of ‘might’ and it provides a non-standard dynamic semantic entry for conjunction: merely intersecting the result of the two updates rather than having consecutive updates. Standardly, we would view conjunction and epistemic necessity modals as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(c[\phi \land \psi ] = (c[\phi])c[\psi]\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(c[\Box \phi] = c [\lnot \Diamond \lnot \phi] = \{ w \in c : c[\phi] = c \}\)</span></p>
<p>(<em>or, equivalently:</em></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(c[\Box \phi] = \begin{cases} c \text{,  if } c[\phi] \neq c \\ \emptyset \text{,  otherwise} \end{cases}\)</span>)</p>
<h4 id="consistency-and-coherence">Consistency and coherence</h4>
<p>For a sequence of updates <span class="math inline">\(\phi_1 \ldots \phi_n\)</span> we can define whether it is <em>consistent</em> or <em>coherent</em> as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\phi_1 \ldots \phi_n\)</span> is <em>consistent</em> if there exists a context <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(c[\phi_1] \ldots [\phi_n] \neq \emptyset\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\phi_1 \ldots \phi_n\)</span> is <em>coherent</em> if there exists a context <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(c[\phi_1] \ldots [\phi_n] = c\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can extend these definition to single formulas in the usual way. With dynamic conjunction the consistency and/or coherence of a sequence is equivalent to the consistency and/or coherence of the conjunction of its members in sequential order.</p>
<h4 id="belief">Belief</h4>
<p>What is it to believe a CCP in this semantic system? If a belief state, <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> determines a set of worlds <span class="math inline">\(b_s\)</span> consistent with beliefs at <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(b_s\)</span> counts as believing a CCP <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(b_s[\phi] = b_s\)</span> (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(b_s\)</span> is a fixed point of <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>). We can extend this to belief in a sequence of updates in the expected way: <span class="math inline">\(b_s\)</span> counts as believing the sequence <span class="math inline">\(\phi_1 \ldots \phi_n\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(b_s[\phi_1] \ldots [\phi_n] = b_s\)</span>. Note that belief in a sequence is only possible if the sequence is coherent.</p>
<p>We can extend the language to include belief attributions as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(c[\text{John believes } \phi] = \{ w \in c : j_w [\phi] = j_w \}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(j_w\)</span> are all the worlds consistent with John’s beliefs at <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>.</p>
<p>We now can see that <span class="math inline">\(c[\text{John believes }\Diamond a ] = \{ w \in c : j_w \cap a \neq \emptyset \}\)</span> = those worlds in <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> where John has a belief world in which <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is true. See <span class="citation">Yalcin (2007)</span> for arguments that this is a good result.</p>
<h4 id="epistemic-contradictions">Epistemic contradictions</h4>
<p>Note that the sequence <span class="math inline">\(a, \Diamond \lnot a\)</span> is neither consistent nor coherent, while the sequence <span class="math inline">\(\Diamond \lnot a, a\)</span> is consistent but not coherent.</p>
<p>Veltman and others have made much of the order sensitivity of consistency. However, it is not clear to me what important empirical implications this has.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Yalcin (2007)</span> noted that <em>epistemic contradictions</em> of the form <span class="math inline">\(p \land \Diamond \lnot p\)</span> or conversely <span class="math inline">\(\Diamond \lnot p \land p\)</span> seem not only unassertable (as to be expected as they are Moorean paradoxical), but also do not embed well in various environments such as under ‘suppose’:</p>
<ol class="example" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>? Suppose it’s raining and it might not be raining.</li>
</ol>
<p>Compare:</p>
<ol start="2" class="example" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Suppose it’s raining and I don’t know it’s raining.</li>
</ol>
<p>This data would seem to be straightforwardly explained by Veltman’s semantics for epistemic modals: as the <span class="math inline">\(\lnot p \land \Diamond p\)</span> is not a coherent and hence it cannot be the content of a suppositional state. (Assuming ‘suppose <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>’ is an instruction to enter a suppositional state with content <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>.)</p>
